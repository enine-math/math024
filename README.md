# Problem No. 24

## Lexicographic Permutations

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

```
012
021
102
120
201
210
```

## Part A

What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Part B

Generalize the solution in Part A to identify the nth lexicographic permutation of a list of numbers and letters.

The list of numbers and letters may be defined as

```python
"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
```

Update the function `solver()` in `solution.py` with your generalized solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math024`

Copy README.md and solution.py into `math024`

Share your solution by updating `answer()` and `solver()` in solution.py.
